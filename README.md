Encrypt and Decrypt text files using a KEY

- To use this application, you will need to provide the path to the input file, the path to the output file, and the key for the substitution cipher. The key should be a string of characters that will be used to encrypt and decrypt the input file.

To **Encrypt** a file, you can use the encrypt command and provide the necessary arguments:

```
python app.py encrypt input_file.txt output_file.txt key
```

To **Decrypt** a file, you can use the decrypt command and provide the same arguments:

```
python app.py decrypt input_file.txt output_file.txt key
```
